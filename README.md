### [Homework1-Week2:javascript —> openframeworks](https://git.arts.ac.uk/22019706/Coding2weeklyhomework/tree/main/H1Weekjstoof)
Transferring the Coding one week 3 homework to open frameworks.The main difficulty is in running the javascript script on the open frameworks framework in c++.Reference is made to the polygonExample of graphics in the openframework example for the programming of two-dimensional graphics and the principles of mouse interaction.![polygonExample](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/555/files/ae0a3c8a-fbda-411e-b73a-946fa78ab7f6)

### [Homework2-Week3:Biods](https://git.arts.ac.uk/22019706/Coding2weeklyhomework/tree/main/H2Week3boid)
Based on the sample code given to a single flock, a second flock is created. Let them be two separate flocks of birds, each flock away from the other. The hardest part was getting the flock to pay attention to the other flock.

### [Homework3-Week4:Arduino](https://git.arts.ac.uk/22019706/Coding2weeklyhomework/tree/main/H3Weekj4arduino)
Adjusted the part of the week2 homework mouse interaction to potentiometers. The main time was spent on the Arduino to openframeworks data transfer. The data transferred was a value passed as a char type, but the char to int conversion would report an error due to storage space issues, and reducing the number of bits of data char would overflow the content of the passed data, so the mapping of the passed data was turned down in advance in the arduino code. int a = atoi(receivedData) inadvertently found that atoi could be performed without I don't know if it's a performance issue with the computer or if it's just the performance of the computer. I don't know if it's the performance of the computer or the performance of the software in the transfer of data, but running the project in openframeworks linked to Arduino causes the whole file to fizzle out after a certain amount of time and forces the software to close. At the moment there is no solution but to run the project for a short time.
